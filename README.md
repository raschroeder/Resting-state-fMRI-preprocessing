# Resting-state-fMRI-preprocessing

**A Matlab-based software package for preprocessing resting-state fMRI data.**

**It has been tested under Linux CentOS 7.2 and Ubuntu 16.04.**

**To use this software, you should have:**

 1. Matlab 2015b or higher;
 2. FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki);
 3. AFNI (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/);
 4. Make sure that all the .m files in this package and the BrainWavelet toolbox (http://www.brainwavelet.org/) are in your Matlab Path.

**The preprocessing steps include:**

 1. fMRI data brain extraction (bet in FSL).
 2. Slice timing correction (slicetimer in FSL).
 3. Motion correction (mcflirt in FSL).
 4. Smoothing (fslmath in FSL).
 5. Wavelet Despiking (BWT).
 6. Regress out WM/CSF/Motion parameters and temporal filtering (3dTproject in AFNI).
 7. FunImg register to T1, then normalize to 3mm Standard Space (BBR, flirt and fnirt in FSL).
 8. T1 data are also preprocessed duing these steps (bet,fast,flirt,fnirt).

**Arrange your data in a folder as the 'example' folder :**

('data' is a folder, 'subject 1',..., 'subject n' are folders, 'T1' are folders)

(/subject_k_rest.nii.gz/ is the resting-state fMRI data for k-th subjects. The name of the data is arbitrary.)

(/subject_k_t1.nii.gz/ is the resting-state fMRI data for k-th subjects. The name of the data is arbitrary.)

```
                                |---/subject_1_rest.nii.gz/
            |---'subject 1'-----|---'T1'---/subject_1_t1.nii.gz/
                                |---/subject_2_rest.nii.gz/
            |---'subject 2'-----|---'T1'---/subject_2_t1.nii.gz/
    'data'--                    |---....nii.gz
            |---...........-----|---'T1'---....nii.gz
                                |---/subject_n_rest.nii.gz/
            |---'subject n'-----|---'T1'---/subject_n_t1.nii.gz/

```
**Set the parameters in the 'Script_to_run.m' script, and type**
```
nohup matlab -nodisplay <Scipt_to_Run.m> report.log &
```
**in the terminal to begin the preprocessing. If something goes wrong, you can just delete the 'bad' data and rerun the above command. The software will automatically continue to process the steps that have not been done.**

**Outputs of this software:**

1. The file 'FunImg_3mmStdSpace.nii.gz' and 'FunImg_3mmStdSpace_NoGlobalSignal.nii.gz' in the '7_FunImg_to_Std' folder is data you can use for further analysis. 'FunImg_3mmStdSpace.nii.gz' is the data in the 3mm standard space with global signal. 'FunImg_3mmStdSpace_NoGlobalSignal.nii.gz' is the data in the 3mm standard space with global signal being regressed out.
  
2. The file 'meanFD_power.1D' in the '3_Motion_Corrected' folder is the mean Framewise displacement (FD) of this subject.

3. The file '**_normalization.tif' is a picture for checking the spatial normalization of fMRI data and T1 data. The first column the normalized fMRI data in standard space, and the second column is the normalized T1 data in standard space, and the third column is the template.

4. The file '**_6head_motion.tif' is a picture that shows the 6 ridge-body transformation parameters estimated in the motion correction step by mcflirt in FSL.
